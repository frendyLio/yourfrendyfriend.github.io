  At the begining.
</h1>
<p>My team and I started with mainly on learning the basic of Kali Linux. We were tasked with reading through a pre-prepared book teaching the basics of wireless communications and the various protocols associated with the security of these devices.</p>

<p>For this project, me and my partner took turns recreating the various types of attacks from ‚ÄúEvil Twin‚Äù attacks, to ‚Äúman-in-the-middle.‚Äù At the end of the project we were to demonstrate what we learned by creating a bash script which would all or part of the proccess. I took to automating the packet injecting process. This process involves the use of the aircrack-ng suite that is preinstalled in Kali Linux. My script allowed for a continuous stream of packets to be captured by our WiFi card for the other proccess that needed them.</p>
