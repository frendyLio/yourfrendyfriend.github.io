Planet JavaScript, a popular planet that is being around 1995. Thousand of people visit this planet and decide to be a resident of it. People from the planet Java believe the JavaScript would have the same environment as Java; little did they know, that they were so wrong; Java and JavaScript are not related to each other by any way. JavaScript is a really good environment to live since it is an easy place to get adjusted to even if you have not prior experience from living in other planets such as Java, C, C++ and so on.

To be sincere, Javascript is such an EASY place to get use to. Compare to my old place, C++, JavaScript makes my life easier by creating the most essential thing for my life, variables. In C++, i need to be careful and declare if my variables are integers, strings, characters or any other type of variables. In JavaScript, I just grab a variable and it can be anything I want! I do not need to declare the variable in JavaScript, I just grab it and it can be anything I want. Beside this, JavaScript make it so easy to make house, or how other people call it, web pages. There are lot of resources like API that will help me enhance and make my house even faster! Overall, I believe this planet is a really great place to build houses.

<p>q. Why did the developer go broke? a. Because he used up all his cache</p>

<p>So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?</p>

<p>What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?</p>
