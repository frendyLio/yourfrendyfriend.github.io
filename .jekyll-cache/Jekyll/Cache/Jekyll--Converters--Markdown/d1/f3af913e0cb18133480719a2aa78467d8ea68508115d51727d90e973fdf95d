<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> To answer this question, please look at the picture above. It just took me a couple of seconds to put the image on the top and to fit the width of this page, it does not matter if you looking this on the phone on the computer, the image will always fit the size of your screen. If I have not used a framework it would have taken me hours to make it look as pretty as it looks now. Frameworks will help you save time in the long run.

    Another example will be the two button bellow. The left one I used frameworks to make, the one in the right I did not use any framework.

<h2 id="what-are-smart-questions-and-dumb-questions">What are Smart questions and dumb questions?</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> First of all, USE SMART HEADERS! For example; let's say you have an issue with the sound of your computer. A Dumb question would be, "HELP! My Computer does not work :(.". You might be wondering why is this a dumb question, well; first of all, the people that are trying to help you do not know what the issue is, they just know something is wrong. A smart question would be, "My computer sound is not working, I have computer XXX with the following sound software XXX." This is smart question because you are telling them what exactly is the issue, but only that is not enough, you are also telling them information about your computer that might help pinpoint the error.

<h2 id="another-example-of-a-dumb-question">Another Example of a Dumb Question</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> An example of a dumb question is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57887946/some-of-the-aliases-you-requested-do-not-exist" target="_blank"><b>"Some of the aliases you requested do not exist [on hold]"</b></a>. First of all, the -3 stars it has implied that the question is really bad to the point that the person that asked the question put it on the hold. Secondly, by reading the question, People do not really understand what the issue is. Besides this, the user is not providing any extra information on the description to the point that people are trying to help him are telling him that is unclear of what he asking for. In conclusion, this question did not even get an answer because is a dumb question.
</p>

<h2 id="please-ask-smart-questions">Please ask Smart questions</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> Usually, if you need help with something; asking the question is understandable; however, is not understandable to ask dumb questions. If you ask dumb questions, you might not even get any help because people might not understand. Try spending a little bit of time formulating your question so that people can have an easier time understanding your issue so that they can help. Who knows, perhaps by spending time writing your question, you might even answer it yourself.
