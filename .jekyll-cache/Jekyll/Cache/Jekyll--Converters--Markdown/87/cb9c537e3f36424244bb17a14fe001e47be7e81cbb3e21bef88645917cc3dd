<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> JavaScript, a popular country that is being around 1995. Thousand of people visit this country and decide to be a resident of it. People from the country Java believe the JavaScript would have the same environment as Java; little did they know, that they were so wrong; Java and JavaScript are not related to each other by anyway. JavaScript is a really good environment to live since it is an easy place to get adjusted to even if you have not prior experience from living in other country such as Java, C, C++ and so on.

<p style="

<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> To be sincere, Javascript is such an EASY place to get used to. Compare to my old place, C++, JavaScript makes my life easier by creating the most essential thing for my life, variables. In C++, I need to be careful and declare if my variables are integers, strings, characters or any other type of variables. In JavaScript, I just grab a variable and it can be anything I want! I do not need to declare the variable in JavaScript, I just grab it and it can be anything I want. Besides this, JavaScript makes it so easy to make a house, or how other people call it, web pages. There are a lot of resources like API that will help me enhance and make my house even faster! Overall, I believe this country is a really great place to build houses.

<h2 id="should-you-try-this-country">Should you try this country?</h2>
<p style="

  text-justify: inter-word">
<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> The simple answer is YES. Why? Well, if you are interested in creating houses such as Facebook, Google, Youtube or any famous houses. Experiencing JavaScript is a MUST. Even if those famous houses do not fully use JavaScript; they might be based on JavaScript. Another reason why you should try this country is that it will help you open a lot of doors! For example, if you become a resident from JavaScript, you might be able to get its passport which is able to visit other work-countries without requesting any VISA! You will be able to get to some famous countries such as Microsoft, IBM, Amazon and so on! You should totally try it out!
