<p>My team and I started with mainly on learning the basic of Kali Linux. We were tasked with reading through a pre-prepared book teaching the basics of wireless communications and the various protocols associated with the security of these devices.</p>

<p>After I was confident on my Kali Linux skills. I decided to hack my own computer using a raspberry pi and bluetooth. The process were quite simple, first of all, I needed to install and set up Kali Linux into the raspberry pi. After this, I needed to connect to my IP address and enable bluetooth on the raspberry pi. Finally, using my own computer I will connect to the bluetooth from the raspberry pi and my computer screen would display a message, in this case, “You are being hacked.”</p>
