<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> Forget what you learnt from kindergarden. Do not always ask question, only ask smart questions. With asking smart questions I do not mean to be afraid of asking questions; what I mean is to know how to ask questions. I will use Eric Raymon's, <a href=" http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" target="_blank">"How to Ask Questions The Smart Way"</a>, to explain the difference between Smart Questions and Dumb Questions that people do on the web.

<p style=" 
  text-align: justify;

<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> First of all, <b>USE SMART HEADERS!</b> For example; lets say you have an issue with the sound of your computer. A Dumb question would be, <b>"HELP! My Computer does not work :(."</b>. You might be wondering why is this a dumb question, well; first of all, the people that are trying to help you do not know what the issue is, they just know something is wrong. A smart question would be, <b>"My computer sound is not working, I have computer XXX with the following sound sofware XXX." </b> This is smart question because you are telling them what exactly is the issue; but only that is not enough, you are also telling them informationn about your computer that might help pinpoint the error.

<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> An example of a smart question is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51851587/binary-search-function-not-working" target="_blank"><b>"Binary search function not working in Java"</b></a>. The header goes straight to the point. In the descriptoion, the author explains what he think is wrong and puts a copy of his code that he believes is wrong. The question can be retrieved at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51999353/a-b-b-a-in-python-vs-stdswap-in-c">here</a> . The results for asking "smart questions" leads to both efficient and effective help. The question above got five answers and a lot of comments. Each answer is very detailed and rich information. Moreover, the author edited the post to thank everybody and give a conclusion to the question.

<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> For the "stupid questions", there are so many in the Stack Overflow website. Most of the "stupid questions" are being ignored. To find "stupid questions" demonstrates the “not smart way” leads to wrong answers is not easy. Finally, I found one "What is the role of probability in machine learning software? [closed]". The question is so general, and the subject can be found with a lot of information when search by Google. The result will be the answers not lead to both effective and efficient help. "Sorry, but this doesn't look like a programming question," "Agree - I'd recommend removing from SO and posting over at Cross Validated " and "The programming relevance of the original question was unclear." are the examples of the wrong questions lead to wrong answers. The question can be retrieved at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41261834/what-is-the-role-of-probability-in-machine-learning-softwar">here</a> e.

<p>For an engineer, self-study is one crucial skill to become a successful engineer. Before asking a question, research is a requirement. The study will show that you already tried to find an answer, but you can not see the solution. It also shows that you are not lazy, and tried everything before asking for some help.

<h2 id="living-in-country-javascript-what-do-i-think-about-it">Living in country JavaScript, what do I think about it?</h2>
<p style=" 
  text-align: justify;
  text-justify: inter-word">
<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> To be sincere, Javascript is such an EASY place to get used to. Compare to my old place, C++, JavaScript makes my life easier by creating the most essential thing for my life, variables. In C++, I need to be careful and declare if my variables are integers, strings, characters or any other type of variables. In JavaScript, I just grab a variable and it can be anything I want! I do not need to declare the variable in JavaScript, I just grab it and it can be anything I want. Besides this, JavaScript makes it so easy to make a house, or how other people call it, web pages. There are a lot of resources like API that will help me enhance and make my house even faster! Overall, I believe this country is a really great place to build houses.

<h2 id="should-you-try-this-country">Should you try this country?</h2>
<p style=" 
  text-align: justify;
  text-justify: inter-word">
<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> The simple answer is YES. Why? Well, if you are interested in creating houses such as Facebook, Google, Youtube or any famous houses. Experiencing JavaScript is a MUST. Even if those famous houses do not fully use JavaScript; they might be based on JavaScript. Another reason why you should try this country is that it will help you open a lot of doors! For example, if you become a resident from JavaScript, you might be able to get its passport which is able to visit other work-countries without requesting any VISA! You will be able to get to some famous countries such as Microsoft, IBM, Amazon and so on! You should totally try it out!
