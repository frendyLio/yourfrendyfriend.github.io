<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> Planet JavaScript, a popular planet that is being around 1995. Thousand of people visit this planet and decide to be a resident of it. People from the planet Java believe the JavaScript would have the same environment as Java; little did they know, that they were so wrong; Java and JavaScript are not related to each other by any way. JavaScript is a really good environment to live since it is an easy place to get adjusted to even if you have not prior experience from living in other planets such as Java, C, C++ and so on.

<p style="

<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> To be sincere, Javascript is such an EASY place to get use to. Compare to my old place, C++, JavaScript makes my life easier by creating the most essential thing for my life, variables. In C++, i need to be careful and declare if my variables are integers, strings, characters or any other type of variables. In JavaScript, I just grab a variable and it can be anything I want! I do not need to declare the variable in JavaScript, I just grab it and it can be anything I want. Beside this, JavaScript make it so easy to make house, or how other people call it, web pages. There are lot of resources like API that will help me enhance and make my house even faster! Overall, I believe this planet is a really great place to build houses.
