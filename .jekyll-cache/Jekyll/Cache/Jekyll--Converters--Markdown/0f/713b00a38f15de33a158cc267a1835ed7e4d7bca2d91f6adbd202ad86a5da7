<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The UHBer website aims to provide a user-friendly way to organize carpools for those traveling to/from the UH Manoa campus. The main idea of this project is to have two groups of users, Drivers, and Riders. Drivers would be the people that will be driving and Riders will be the people that are riding the car. There will be a scoring system where you will pay with points. If you want to refill your points, you will need to drive.</p>

<h2 id="contribution">Contribution</h2>
<p>One of the main tasks I worked was setting up the Back-End for most of this website; I was in charge of setting up the data for the profile page which was used as a template for setting up the ride page and other pages that required to retrieve data.</p>

<p>Another task that I work was setting up a calendar for our website; as a team, we first decided to implement google calendar into our website; we realize that these would not be feasible with the scope of our project and decided to use fullcalendar.io instead.</p>

<p>Besides this, I also took the role to update the UHber GitHub page so that if a user desire to learn more about this, he or she would be able to run our website in their local machine. In the UHber GitHub page, there is also more detailed information about UHber and the different pages that it has.</p>

<p>Finally, I had the role of managing the team so that everyone could achieve their interests; as well as setting up meetings and deadlines in order to achieve our final goal. In the case of disagreement, I would talk to both parties and try to see if we can achieve the best outcome for them.</p>
