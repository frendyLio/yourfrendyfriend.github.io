    A picture is worth a thousand words.
  <br />
    Similarly, frameworks are worth a thousand lines of code.

<p class="paragraph">
<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> To answer this question, please look at the picture above. It just took me a couple of seconds to put the image on the top and to fit the width of this page, it does not matter if you looking this on the phone on the computer, the image will always fit the size of your screen. If I have not used a framework it would have taken me hours to make it look as pretty as it looks now.

    Another example will be the two-button bellow. For the blue button, I used a framework; the other one, I did not.
    <br /><br />
<div class="ui grid">
  <div class="four wide column">
    <div class="ui primary button">
      <i class="centered shop icon"></i> Add to Cart
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="four wide column">
    <button type="button"> 
          <img src="../images/Frameworks/shopping-card.png" height="20px" />Add to Cart
    </button>
  </div>
</div>

  <br />
  <span style="margin-left:2em"></span> 
    Do you know how long did it took me to make these buttons? Well, for the blue one, it took me a couple of seconds to make the button and get the shopping cart logo. The other one, well, it took me half an hour to make the button and another half an hour to find the shopping cart logo. Frameworks will help you save time.
