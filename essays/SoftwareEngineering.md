<span style="margin-left:2em"></span>  In this blog, I will be talking about things that I have learnt during my time as a software engineering. I will be giving an insight into some important subjects I learnt and how it help me develop better software engineering skills.
</p>

## Coding Standards?

<p style=" 
  text-align: justify;
  text-justify: inter-word">
<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> To put in simple words what are Coding Standards, it is a programming style. It is not related to what is wrong or right when we program our code; it is simply a set of rules and guidelines for the formatting of our code. In general, coding standards are used in order to make a piece of software look like it was developed by only one person since the formatting of the code is the same.
</p>

<p style=" 
  text-align: justify;
  text-justify: inter-word">
<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> Throughout my experience with software engineering, I have learnt how important Coding Standards are. When you work in a team environment were a lot of programmers are working in the same piece of code, you save a lot of time if everybody follows the same coding standards. When you read the code, you understand easier thanks to coding standards.
</p>

<p style=" 
  text-align: justify;
  text-justify: inter-word">
<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> I have learnt the coding standards are meant to be used not only on web application development but as well at any type of development; making an app, working with databases, anything; to be a good software engineering, you must follow a coding standard.
</p>

## User Interface Frameworks?

<p style=" 
  text-align: justify;
  text-justify: inter-word">
<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> User Interface Framework also known as UI framework, are pieces of code that help the speed of development of front-end application or web application development; they enables developers the ability to build fantastic, responsive multi-device application without deep technical and design skills. They make development way easier and less tedious than it already is.
</p>

<p style=" 
  text-align: justify;
  text-justify: inter-word">
<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> One thing I learnt from my software engineering experience is that we should not re-invent the wheel. If I just want to make a really fancy button I would just use a UI framework to this; if I did not, I will be spending a considerable amount of time to make sure that my button works for any device, to make it pretty and so on. UI framework just helps me do what I want in a couple of seconds.
</p>

<p style=" 
  text-align: justify;
  text-justify: inter-word">
<span style="margin-left:2em"></span> I have learnt that UI framework is extraordinarily useful for web development; learning how to use UI framework might take time; however, in the long run, it will save a lot of time when I do web development. I also learnt that if I do any other type of development, I should look at any frameworks that might help me develop faster and more efficiently.
